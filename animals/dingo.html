      <p>The dingo is a wild dog native to Australia, known for its sandy or reddish coat and bushy tail. Dingoes are highly adaptable and can thrive in diverse environments, from deserts to forests. They are opportunistic hunters and scavengers, feeding on small mammals, birds, and even insects. Dingoes are social animals, often living in packs, and play a key role in Australia's ecosystem.</p>
