      <p>The red panda, also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. With its reddish-brown fur and bushy tail, it resembles a raccoon more than a giant panda. Red pandas are arboreal and primarily feed on bamboo, but they also eat fruits, acorns, and insects. They are solitary and nocturnal, spending most of their time in trees.</p>
