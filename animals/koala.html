      <p>The koala is a small, tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia. Often called a "koala bear," it is not actually a bear but belongs to the marsupial family. Koalas are herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which provide both food and water. They are known for their sleepy demeanor, spending up to 20 hours a day resting in trees.</p>
