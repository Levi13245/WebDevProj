      <p>The cougar, also known as the puma or mountain lion, is a large cat native to the Americas. It is an adaptable predator found in a variety of habitats, from forests to deserts. Cougars are solitary and stealthy hunters, preying on deer, elk, and smaller mammals. They are known for their powerful build, agility, and ability to leap great distances.</p>
